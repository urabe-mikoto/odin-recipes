        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>To Prepare the Ingredients</p>
        <ol>         
            <li>Chop the onion into small pieces and cut the carrots into small chunks.</li>
            <li>Lightly mash the boiled chickpeas.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To Make Boiled and Peeled Tomatoes</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the stem of the tomato and make a cross-shaped shallow slit on the opposite side of the stem.</li>
            <li>Put the tomatoes into boiled water and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place in ice water and peel off the tomato skin with your fingers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To Cook the Curry</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and saut√© the onions until they become translucent and tender.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and cook until it's no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add the carrot and mix well to coat with oil.</li>
            <li>Add a water and bay leaf and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, using a small fine-mesh strainer, skim the scrum from the surface of the broth.</li>
            <li>Cover and simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes. If the heat is too high, lower the heat slightly.</li>
            <li>(You can make curry roux from scratch while the curry ingredients are simmering.)</li>

            <li>Add the pre-cooked curry roux powder to the pot.</li>
            <li>Stir slowly over low heat until melted.</li>
            <li>Cook over low heat for 5 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken. Be careful not to get burned and stuck to the pan.</li>
